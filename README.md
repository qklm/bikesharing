# Overview of the statistical analysis:
We looked at citibike's public data from the month of August in 2019 and broke down the data by user supplied information to examine use patterns.

## Results:

[In these panels](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.brown2622/viz/UCB-Data-W14-Challenge/Story1) we can see some clear use patterns:

* Citibike's are used predominantly by males. Use time is largely around traditional 9 to 5 jobs. 
* Usage (distance and/or time rented) is largely similar for males, females, and unknowns. 
* Most trips are under 20 minutes. 
* Subcribers make up the largest consistent userbase.

## Summary:

Citibike is widely used, mostly by male commuters and usually for short distances.
